00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
As I mentioned before, PHP has an excellent documentation. You'll find it on the php.net website in the

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
manual documentation section, however, there are some very, very useful shortcuts, so PHP supports a lot of

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
vanity URLs. So if you append, say, a function name, or the name of a constant or some other special terms

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to the URL, so if, for instance, you go to php.net/phpinfo, you go to the manual page for phpinfo,

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
this works in most cases. So let's have a look.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
As you can see here, php.net/manual gets you to the PHP Manual and you're automatically redirected into the

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
language version of your browser's language setting. Of course the English version of the PHP Manual is

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
usually the one that's most up-to-date, but as you can see here there are several other languages supported

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
as well. Also we have the shortcut URLs so we can go to php.net/phpinfo, and we are then redirected to the

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
phpinfo Manual page, and as I mentioned it works for most of the built-in functions.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Also there's some generic terms like install, so if we go to php.net/install and this leads us to the Installation

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
section including some other not-so-common shortcuts like install.windows, which leads us to, you may have

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
guessed it, the Windows Installation page. Obviously that only works when you're online.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Your IDE might provide you with an offline version of the manual, however, there is one on the php.net

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
website as well. In order to get access to that offline version of the PHP manual, go to the Downloads

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
section of the php.net website and then on the right you have the documentation download link.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This leads you to a page where you can download the manual in a variety of formats including one single

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
big HTML file, many HTML files, and probably most convenient, an HTML Help file.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So you have the usual chm format, as long as you have a chm viewer, which is automatically the case on

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Windows, in order to have a look at that content. There are two versions of the HTML Help file.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
One that just contains the manual and another one which also contains user notes, and user notes is another

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
very useful feature of the PHP online manual. If you go to an arbitrary manual page like the phpinfo,

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
mail page we saw before you'll see that there is some description about that function, however, at the end they are

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
User Contributed Notes, which start right here. And what happens here is that it's a created list of user

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
suggestions and user postings providing additional information, workarounds, common issues, etc., etc.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Of course, not all of the code snippets in there and not all of the advice in there is always valuable

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
or even factually correct, but most of it is pretty good, it gives you some very common workarounds,

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
some very common have to knows about certain pages in the PHP Manual and features that come along with it.
