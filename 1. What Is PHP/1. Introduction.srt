Hi, and welcome to Pluralsight. My name is Christian Wenz, and I would like to help you get started with

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
PHP, the world's most loved and most used web-scripting language.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
During the course of this module, I will give you some background information on PHP, tell you why it is so

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
popular, and then install PHP on a web server so that it can serve PHP content.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Once everything has been set up and is working properly, we'll do an obligatory Hello World! application,

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
however, it's a more sophisticated version of Hello World! than you may have seen before.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But what better way to start talking about PHP than with a quote by the man himself, Rasmus Lardorf, the

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
inventor, creator, and first developer of PHP. He once said, "I've never thought of PHP as more than a

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:18,000
simple tool to solve problems", and that's exactly the approach and the vision of PHP, to solve problems in a

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
very pragmatic, but still good to high quality fashion. Lerdorf, back then when he created PHP, had a

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
problem to solve himself. He wanted to _____ dynamic content of his web server, but didn't want to use Perl

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
or the other technologies dominant at that time for that purposes, so he created his own language, which

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
would eventually become PHP. He first chatted with his peers, and then he chatted with the world, and the

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
next step was world domination. PHP is very popular. It's used by both smaller websites, smaller blogs,

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
more simple applications, up to very, very large and very complex websites such as Facebook, for instance,

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:17,000
who use PHP a lot. So, PHP is very pragmatic, quite easy to get into, so you do not need a formal background in

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
computer science to create excellent PHP applications. For this course, you will just need some basic HTML

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
knowledge and a knowledge of any programming language doesn't hurt, but it's not utterly required.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now let's have a look about what PHP generally is and let's have a look at more information on that.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,000
PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, and the approach PHP is using can be seen in that definition.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
PHP is usually embedded into hypertext, meaning into HTML, and PHP is actually a preprocessor, so PHP

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
then has a look at that HTML with some PHP code in it, and then works on that PHP code and executes it.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:26,000
PHP's home page is php.net, not .com, php.net, and that website contains a lot of information about the language.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The Home page features the latest versions of PHP, so at the time of recording this, the most recent version

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
is 5.5.15. It will certainly be a higher version number once you are watching this.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We also have access to the documentation, which is very exhaustive, get information about upcoming

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
conferences, and much more information.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Depending on which statistics you're using, you can say PHP has a market share of more or less 40% of the web,

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
40%, so 2 out of 5 websites run with PHP. That's an enormous number, and that's higher than any other

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:30,000
competing technologies. One way of looking at the dominance of PHP is by referring to the TIOBE index.

31
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The creators of this index use a variety of sources and technologies and measurements and metrics in order

32
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to create a monthly list of the most widely used programming languages, general programming languages, not

33
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,000
just web programming languages. So currently we have the TIOBE index of August 2014, and PHP is on position

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
number 8, which is pretty good. One year ago it was even number 5.

35
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now since the beginnings of that index, since 1999, PHP has always been in the top 10, which is an amazing

36
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
achievement, especially considering how many very well-known programming languages are in that index

37
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:32,000
as well, and also how many well-known programming languages are behind PHP in that index.

38
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Probably one of the main reasons why PHP is so popular is that it supports most operating systems and most

39
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:51,000
web servers. So PHP runs under Linux, under Windows, under Mac OSX, under Solaris, under other even more

40
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
exotic operating systems, and it supports the Apache web server, the IIS web server from Microsoft, and many more.

41
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So we have a web scripting language that is rather easy to learn, it's proven in the real world, it has a

42
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
huge market share, and a legion of developers that can help out each other, it is in the top 10 since over

43
00:06:17,000 --> 00:59:00,000
15 years, and runs almost anywhere, so it's a pretty safe bet to use PHP.
