1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In order to install PHP, we first have to acquire to download it.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
For that we have two options, either we can go to the PHP Home page and the PHP website has a download

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
section where we can get both the source code and pre-compiled binaries of PHP, or if we are Windows users

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we can go to Windows.php.net where we find Windows binaries of PHP.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The PHP Download section focuses on the PHP source codes or if you want to build PHP by yourself, that's the

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
way to go. Otherwise, there are links to downloads for specific operating systems, most prominently Windows

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
on the windows.php.net. That's a specific website just for Windows users where the PHP Windows team, which

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
in part is even funded by Microsoft, provides up-to-date releases of PHP compiled for Windows systems, not

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
only for the IIS web server for Microsoft, but also for Apache web server and other systems,

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but it separates it from the rest. Other operating systems like Linux, for instance, have package managers

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which can install PHP with the web server. Some operating systems even come with PHP already installed or

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
at least built-in. So depending on your operating systems, the steps to get a working PHP system up and

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
running might a bit different.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
One of the most convenient ways to get started with a PHP setup is to use an all-in-one installer, which

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
both installs the web server and PHP, and maybe some other useful software as well.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There are several options, and the one we have chosen is a product from apachefriends.org.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Those friends of Apache provide very popular distribution calls XAMPP.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The A stands for Apache, the M for MySQL, which is a database which we will cover later in this course, and

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:43,000
the first P stands for PHP and the second P stands for Perl. The X signifies that XAMPP is not tied to a

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
specific operating system. There are versions for Windows, there are versions for Linux, there are versions

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
for other operating systems. And the basic idea behind XAMPP is that you have one installer and that installer

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
installs you all required software packages and they come preconfigured.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So not only does XAMPP install you an Apache web server, and not only does XAMPP install you PHP, _____ the

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
web server is also configured so that it can use PHP right away. So that's really, really convenient, and

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
probably the easiest way to get your first own system up and running for development purposes.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The Download section of apachefriends.org provides XAMPP for a variety of operating systems.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You see your Windows, Linux, and some others further down. And what you basically do is you download the

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
package and then you get a kind of installer, which you just have to run and then everything is set up

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
automatically for you. I happen to have the XAMPP installer for Windows here, so I'll just run this and

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
show you how it works. Again, if you have a different operating system or a different _____ of web server,

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
don't worry, there are detailed installation instructions for you on the PHP Home page.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The XAMPP installer first warns me about User Account Control and that I should not install XAMPP into the

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Program Files folder because it's harder to write PHP files into that folder later on, and I'll adhere to that.

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But the most important step is which components I want. I can pick and choose what is installed by XAMPP

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and what I do not need. Now you can pick anything, because later you will choose which of those components

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
are actually running, but if you are certain that you do not need some of those components you can just

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
deselect them, and that's what I will be doing right now because I do not need Apache, that's mandatory.

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I do need MySQL choice the database for later. I do not need an FTP Server or a Mail Server or an application

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
server, so I deselect those three. I do need PHP, I even cannot deselect it, but I do not want Perl.

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will need phpMyAdmin to administer the database later on. I do not need Webalizer.

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will probably need Fake Sendmail to test sending emails out later on.

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The recommended installation folder is usually a good choice, so I'll just stick to that.

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I do not want more information about the Bitnami Company who provides installers that also configure

44
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
applications like WordPress or Joomla! with the web server and PHP I don't need that right now so I deselect

45
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
that, and well, then I'm ready, and the distribution is installed on my system.

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This will take a while, so I will use advanced video editing techniques to fast-forward to the end of that

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
installation, but what basically happens is that all files required for our PHP, all files required for the

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Apache web server, and so on and so forth, are copied into my system, and then configured so that the system

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:25,000
is ready to wrap, and we're done. The installer now provides us with the option to start the XAMPP Control

50
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Panel, and that's a very important tool for XAMPP because it's a kind of management console that gives us

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
easy access to the components we installed. We can start those components, we can stop them, we can even

52
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
install them as a service. So we are focusing now on Apache, we can start Apache, we could also then if

53
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Apache is running, stop Apache. We can also install Apache as a service if we click on the checkbox on the

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
left so it's automatically running once the machine boots up. At the moment, I just want to start Apache,

55
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:17,000
so I click on the Start button, and after a short while Apache is running and we can have a look at the

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:28,000
running system. In order to do so, we just fire up a web browser and go to localhost, and then have a direct

57
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:37,000
access to the XAMPP installation. We have to pick a language just once, it just remembers it, and then we

58
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
get the XAMPP Start page which looks like this. So we see the XAMPP version, we see the version of PHP

59
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
being used, and we have access to several options and further applications.

60
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So, for instance, we can have a look at the status of the installation which tells us which services and

61
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
components are installed and running. We get access to the documentation, to components, etc., etc.

62
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We can also have access to various PHP sample applications which just prove us that the system is up and

63
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
running correctly.

64
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And again, using XAMPP or one of the other all-in-one tools is not mandatory.

65
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You can install PHP manually as well, and the best way to start doing that is to go to the PHP online manual

66
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
at php.net/install.

67
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:44,000
There you'll find detailed information on a variety of systems, so you see Unix systems, Mac OS X, Windows

68
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:54,000
systems, different versions, different type of web service, so a lot of information so that almost all cases

69
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
are covered by very exhaustive information here in the PHP online manual.

70
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So installing PHP is actually pretty easy. Just download PHP or a preexisting installer, and then you are

71
00:09:11,000 --> 00:59:00,000
ready to go, ready to get started with your own custom PHP code.
