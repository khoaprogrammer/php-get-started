00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Before we reach the end of our brief introduction, I have to tell you a little bit more about the history

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of PHP and the pivotol version numbers PHP saw in its past.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It all started in 1994 when, aforementioned, Rasmus Lerdorf started working on a set of tools, which at first

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
he only used for himself, then showed them to some of this closer peers in University.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
One year later, in 1995, he released those tools and called them Personal Home Page Tools or PHP Tools.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Usually this would be the end of the story, because well, those tools were used at the university, and they

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
were also used by some people outside the university, but still, the traction wasn't that high.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It was pretty successful, but not that many people actually used it.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It wasn't mainstream yet. However, some time later Lerdorf was approached by two Israeli students, Zeev

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Suraski and Andi Gutmans, and they approached him and suggested some changes for the way PHP was parsing code.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Lerdorf was very happy with the suggestions by those two students, and told them to go ahead.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They did, and the result was PHP version 3, which also was the first PHP version to support Windows, which

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
was not used that much for hosting back in the day, but of course, still had that gigantic market share for

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
developer systems and especially for desktop systems, which many people used even for programming.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
With version 3 of PHP, its market share and usage skyrocketed. It was used all over the world, even more so

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
when 2 years later, in 2000, PHP 4 was a new major release. It had a new core, the so-called "Zend Engine".

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now Zend is the name of a company Suraski and Gutman set up. You can see that the name of the company is

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
built from the two first names of those gentlemen. Zend employs a lot of developers of PHP, but it doesn't

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
really control PHP. It is still an open source, community-driven effort.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Zend just sells a couple of additional services and software for PHP, for instance, Zend Studio, an IDE for PHP.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now PHP 4, with this new core, the Zend Engine, featured more OOP features because PHP 3 actually had, well,

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
no features for object-oriented programming, PHP 4 had a little bit more of that.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It also came with series session support. And again, more and more people were using it, more and

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
more websites were built based on PHP. The next major release was PHP 5, and it took the project 4 years

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:20,000
in order to make this release. PHP 5 comes with a lot of new features, but many of those features are

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
around object-oriented programming. There are many new OOP features, well new for PHP, other languages had

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that since years, but still, a lot of OOP was added, so more and more professional applications, more and

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
more professional code could be developed with PHP, thanks to that version.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The number after 5 is 6, and so the PHP developer team worked on PHP 6, which among other things, should

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
come with full Unicode support. However, this proved to be quite a task, and so eventually that project was

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
abandoned. PHP was supposed to come with a lot of new features, Unicode just being one of those features.

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So eventually it was decided that all of the other features were good enough for a new major release, just

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the Unicode stuff would not make it, so they released PHP 5.3. PHP 6 never saw the day of light.

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
PHP 5.3 came with many, many new features and was the new de facto standard.

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So although it's only a minor version number update, there was 5.1 and 5.2 in between as well, by the way,

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:56,000
5.3 is the new PHP version, the new big version after PHP 5. After 5.3, followed 5.4 and 5.5, and as I'm

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
recording this, PHP version 5.6 is about to be released. Just a few days now and whenever you are

38
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
listening to this, 5.6 will have been released, so it will be the most current version.

39
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maybe there is even a more recent version of that. 2014, at the time when I am recording this, also saw

40
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
two other new developments. One is that the final update for 5.3 has been released so there won't be any

41
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
new updates for PHP 5.3 as of August 2014. That means if you should still be using 5.3 or your hosting

42
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
provider is still using 5.3, you will have an outdated version, so you should seriously consider upgrading

43
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
your PHP version. Also, the version number for the next major version of PHP has been determined.

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There was a long debate whether it should be PHP 6 or PHP 7 or something entirely different, but since PHP 6

45
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
is still remembered by some as that version that never came to be, the team decided to call the next major

46
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
version PHP 7, so let's see when this will come out, but until then 5. something, at least 5.6 is the version

47
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
we are about to work with.

48
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So in conclusion, we saw that PHP is very, very popular. It's supported by most operating systems, most

49
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
web servers, and a very large number of developers. You saw how to install PHP on a specific system.

50
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We learned about phpinfo, the Hello World! on steroids. We learned how to use the owner manual, for

51
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
instance, to look up how to install PHP on another system or another web server, and we had a quick dash

52
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
through the history of PHP and relevant version numbers. So we had a great start, and I hope you are looking

53
00:06:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
forward to continue to getting started with PHP.
