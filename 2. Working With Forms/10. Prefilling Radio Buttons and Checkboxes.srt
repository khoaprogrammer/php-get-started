1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We continue with the next type of fields, the radio buttons and checkboxes.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now for those we first have to find out whether they have been activated when the form was submitted.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's a bit easier for the checkbox, it's a bit more complicated for the radio buttons because we have several

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
radio buttons. We need to find out which one has been activated, if any.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then if we have found it out we have to make sure that using HTML means those are activated again.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The HTML attribute we need to use here is called checked. We go back to the code.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's start with the checkbox at the very end, and if the checkbox has been selected, we need to add checked

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but when do we add checked? Well, if we add it if the value of $tc, remember the variable that holds the

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
current value of the checkbox = "ok". So, once again, it's time for a php block in here, and in that php

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:22,000
block all we are doing is if $tc === 'ok', then we just echo out checked.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And I also echo out a blank space character so that it nicely fits into the HTML markup.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And this very approach is the same we will be doing for the radio buttons up here, same thing.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We add a php block, and in that php block, after I re-fix the indentation, we have a look at this time the

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
gender variable, remember that will be set with the input in the gender field.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And if the gender variable has a value of, in that case, f for female, we echo out checked, as simple as that.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Otherwise, we don't do anything and the radio button is not pre-checked.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Same thing here, so I add a new php block and in that php block I do essentially the same thing as before,

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:33,000
so I do an if $gender ===, and in that case 'm' for male, and if so, I echo ' checked'.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And now this field is also properly prefilled, if it has been prefilled before, so far, so good.
