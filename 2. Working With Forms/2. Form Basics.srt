00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
After we have covered all those basics, now let's have a look at all those form elements HTML is providing

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for us, and how we can use them from PHP. First you see several types of text fields.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There is a single-line text field, there is a password field, which essentially is a single-line text field,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
but the input is masked, and there is a multi-line text field. We have the input HTML element for most of

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
form elements. One of the very few exceptions is the multi-line text field, which is done via the text area tag.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So basically we have several fields, several HTML form types, and each of them should have the name attribute

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
set because we will use the name there later to access the value in those fields.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Next up we have radio buttons and checkboxes. So a checkbox is just input type= "checkbox" with, of course,

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
again a name and a value. And as we'll see later, if the checkbox is activated, the value is sent to the

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
server. If not, then nothing is sent to the server. But more interesting are radio buttons, because radio

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
buttons always occur in groups. There is a group of radio buttons, and you can only select one of those

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
radio buttons at a time. In order to do that, you have to tell the browser which of the radio buttons on the

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
page are in the same group. You do this by using the name attribute.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
All radio buttons that have the same name attribute are part of the same group.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So how do you distinguish the individual radio buttons? Well there still is the value attribute, and the

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
value attribute needs to be different. So if you have a group of radio buttons, the value of the radio

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
button that has been selected is sent to the server, or the other radio buttons are kind of ignored from a

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
server point of view. And finally, we will later have a look at selection lists.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So we have the select HTML form element, and each individual entry in that list is put into HTML using the

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
option tag or the option element. You have a caption for each element that's within the option tag, but you

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
also have a value. Quite often, actually, the value is the same as the caption, however, the value is what

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
is being sent back to the server, the caption isn't. The only exception, if there is no value at all, then

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
the caption is sent to the server. There are other form elements in HTML.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Actually we will see one of them a bit later on, a button because we have to submit the form somehow, but

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
basically these are the ones you'll see and use most often in the web.
