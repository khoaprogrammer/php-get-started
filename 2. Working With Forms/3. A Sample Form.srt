00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I have already prepared an HTML form for us to play with. This form contains those HTML elements I mentioned,

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and also one or two special items, which we'll talk about a bit later.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So here is the markup of that form. It's a PHP file, because we later want to add the PHP code, of course,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but at the moment it only contains HTML markup. It contains a form and use http POST as a method.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You could also use GET, of course, but we'll use POST this time. The action is set to an empty string so

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that if the form is submitted back to the server the same script is run as the one that produces the form,

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
so it's form.php, that's exactly what we want. We then have a single-line text input field, a single-line

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
password field. We have to radio buttons in the same group for the gender of a person.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then we have a selection list with three items to choose from. By default, that's a dropdown list.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We also have a multiple-selection list where users can select more than one entry.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We also have a multi-line text input, the text area here, we have a checkbox to accept the terms and

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
conditions, and finally, we have a new HTML form element we didn't cover before,

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
we have input type="submit", which essentially is a submit button.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So once we click on that button, the form data, the input of the user, is sent to the server where we will

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
eventually process those data.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And this is how the form looks in a web browser. So we see the text field, we see the password field, the

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
radio buttons, the drop-down list, the multiple-selection list, we see the Comments field, and we see the

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
checkbox. Finally we have a Submit button to send the data back to the server.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then on the server we, of course, would like to process the data, for instance, validate it or just output

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
it, kind of a form Hello World!, and that's what we are about to do right now.
