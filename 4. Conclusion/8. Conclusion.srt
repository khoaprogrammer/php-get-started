1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We have added quite a number of little and not so little things to our sample application in this module.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we saw how PHP can include files, external PHP files with code, and also files like HTML or even CSS files

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with markup or other information, and we saw how to use those files from within our PHP code.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We saw in require, require_once, include, include_once, and readfile.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Also, we had a look at the Password Hashing API, which is a super easy way to actually store passwords in

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a secure fashion, so much better than MD5 or SHA1 or some of the other hashing algorithms or even storing

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
passwords in clear text, which is certainly a very bad idea. Then we had a look at sessions and saw how

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
easy it is to use sessions from PHP code, you just have to start session support and then have the $_SESSION

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
array where we can write stuff to and read stuff from, and this array is retrieved and is retained between

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
individual HTTP request, so we keep the data within that array. And finally, and most importantly, I hope you

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
enjoyed getting started with PHP, and I wish you a lot of fun with this language and all of the tools and

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
libraries around that, and happy PHP'ing.
