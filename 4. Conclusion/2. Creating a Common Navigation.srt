00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's try out include files, and specifically including files with HTML or CSS so we have to use a readfile.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
One idea, for instance, would be that we have a common navigation for all pages within our small sample

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
application. So let's do exactly that. I will add a new file and well I could call it HTMl File, I could

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
also give it a specific file extension so that I know exactly that it's something I include, but

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
it depends on a variety of factors. I'll just call it navigation.tmpl, for template, .html.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And in that file I will create a very, very simple navigation to be used in our application, so I'll just

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:07,000
do an unordered list, and each list element is a link to one of those pages we've worked on before, so I'll

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
just call them according to the SQL statements they represent. So we have INSERT, we have SELECT,

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we also had UPDATE, and finally, we had DELETE. So I create this and then I will add some CSS.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I could add the CSS to a global CSS file for the application, but just for the sake of simplicity and so

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that we have everything in one file, I'll just add it directly to the template.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And what I'm doing here is basically telling the browser how to display the list, because I want that don't

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
have those bullet point things, and I also would like to have the list items next to each other, not

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
underneath each other. So I will just do a rule that says, list-style-type equals to none, so I don't want

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:19,000
to have bullets. And also what I'd like to have is that the individual list items that they are next to

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
each other, and I can do this by telling them to display, not as a block element, as they would usually be,

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
but as an inline element. So that's my template, navigation.tmpl.html, and wherever I would like to have

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that template I can call readfile. So let's maybe start with the insert.php page.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A good position for the navigation would be at the very top, so right here.

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So I could do readfile, and then 'navigation.tmpl.html', and this will load the navigation right away.

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll copy that to the clipboard, and I'll add it to the other files as well so that we have the same

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:25,000
navigation in all of our four pages of our application. I just have to put this within php right here,

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
because it's php code. And finally, delete.php, that's a page with very little code, and now let's add some

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
extra code. I will call to readfile. And that basically adds the functionality to our application.

25
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's validate our efforts in the browser. So we'll go to localhost/php-get-started and then say

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
select.php, and indeed, we have our navigation here at the top and we have it on every page, so including

27
00:04:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the external file worked very well for us.
