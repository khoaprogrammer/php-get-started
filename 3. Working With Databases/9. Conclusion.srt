00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We achieved quite a bit in this module, because we were now successfully talking with the database using all

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the standard database operations with PHP. In order to do so, we first set up our database.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We were using phpMyAdmin in order to administer on MySQL Server, one of the most convenient ways of adding

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
databases, users, tables, looking at data, and so on, and so forth.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
PhpMyAdmin can also be very nicely installed at your hosting provider, but of course, you have to make sure

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that you're the only one that runs phpMyAdmin in order to administer your databases.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, maybe after configuration of your database, remove phpMyAdmin from your server or use password

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
protection or some other safeguards. After we have set up our database and we've set up our table, we

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
wrote a UI in order for reading data, writing data, updating data, deleting data, using the mysqli_

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
extension PHP provides, and the mysqli functions in order to communicate with the database server.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
SQL injection is one of the greatest dangers for database-based applications because a user might be able

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to send malicious content, which in turn is sent to the database and the database interprets it as an SQL

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
command, which we do not want, so we were escaping special characters and thus avoided SQL injection.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And, once again, we did not cover the object-oriented interface for the mysqli extension.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We also did not cover other extensions which allow us to talk to a MySQL database, but the features set is

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
more or less the same, so you are good to go now and can use PHP to talk to any MySQL database, and you can

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
read data, write data, and do all the operations you want. Although our sample application works as

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
expected, we are still not done. There are so many more features we might want to add.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
One of them, and that's probably the most pressing one, is authorization/authentication,

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
so it's time to move on.
