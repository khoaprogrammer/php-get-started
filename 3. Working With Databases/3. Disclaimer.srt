00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Before we actually write some code, a couple of disclaimers. First of all, there is more than one way to

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
achieve what we want to achieve. We have already decided on using MySQL as the database of choice,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
however, even that gives us several possibilities of how to talk to the database from PHP.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
PHP offers a variety of options. We've chosen the most common one, but even that option we chose provides

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
different APIs, an API that uses OOP and an API that uses functions.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We've decided to use the function-based API because that seems to be more in line with what we've covered

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
in the previous module. Also, we do not do a lot of error detection or prevention, or even error handling

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
in our sample, because our focus is on how to communicate with the database, so we skipped that for the sake

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
of what we want to achieve here and what we want to learn, but of course, in a real-life project you need to do that

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:20,000
definitely. We use XAMPP installation, which as I mentioned previously, comes with an insecure default root user

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that is allowed to do everything without any password. Of course, that's just the local system, but of

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
course on a system that's accessible from somewhere else, from the outside or from someone else within

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
your own home network, you need to use a different setting, but we skipped that because every system is

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
different and it's hard to give a very, very common guideline here, except from create a unique user that

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
can only access the database we just created _____. And finally, we do not spend a lot of time on designing our UI,

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
well, actually almost no time on designing the UI, so it's not pretty, but it will work and that's the main thing.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And with that, let's start.
