Hello, and welcome to Working With Databases. After we've set up our PHP system and learned the basics of

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
working with forms, we would like to process form data even further, and that's where databases come into play.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll first set up a database and we will use a web-based tool, which also uses PHP by the way, called

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
phpMyAdmin. Then we'll do the standard database operations. We will insert data, we will read the data

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
back from the database, we'll update the information in the database, and finally, we will delete the data.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
However, before we even try to connect to our database, it has to run first.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, if you haven't done it already, make sure that your database is running properly on your system.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In my case, I have XAMPP installed here, as we saw previously, and as you can see here in the Apache control

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
panel as part of the XAMPP Control Panel, Apache is running, so the web server is already there and works,

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
however, what does not work is the database yet, MySQL. So what I'll do is I'll start the database and after

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
a short MySQL is backgrounded with green, so it's running and we can work with the database.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It might look different on your system, you might need to go to Windows Services, for instance, and then

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
start the MySQL service if you haven't started _____ service on other systems the database might need to be

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
run manually from the command line. It depends on your system, but just make sure that the database runs,

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and from then on you can continue.
