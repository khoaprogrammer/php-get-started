1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I once again connect to the database, so mysqli_connect to 'localhost' using

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:24,000
our user and also connecting to the php database specifically. Then I copy together the sql string, so

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
sprintf of something, which is to be defined. Now this time I need an update statement, so UPDATE users

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
SET, and then name= value, so I set the name to something using a placeholder, I set the gender to something

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
using a placeholder again, and finally the color to, you guessed it, a placeholder again.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Very, very important now, this statement will update each and every record which we obviously do not want,

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
so we need to add a WHERE clause, easy to forget that until you try it.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So WHERE id= another placeholder. Next we fill those placeholders, remember we work with data coming from

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the user, so there might be special characters inside. We need to escape them in order to prevent SQL

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
injection, so we do mysqli_real_escape_string of, in that case, name, and then, once again,

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:42,000
mysqli_real_escape_string of the gender, and finally mysqli_real_escape_string of the color.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The fourth placeholder is the id, but remember we read the id from the URL so it's user data, however, we

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
checked whether the id only consists of digits, so we know only digits, so we do not need to do additional

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
escaping, so we just put in the id here, we have valid SQL string, which we send to the database using

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:15,000
mysqli_query. Afterwards we output what we've done, so User updated.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We could also redirect to the overview page, which would be fine as well, but I think this is good enough for now.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And finally, we close the connection to the database, which actually we could also do down here, so we

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
close the connection here as well, just some cleaning up, alright.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now next up we need to run the update.php file in our browser, however, if we do so and do not provide an

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
id in the URL, we get redirected to the overview page, hmm, that's what we want, but actually we would like

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:07,000
to see the update.php page in action, so we need to provide an id, and we need to add the id when we actually

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
run the page. However, there is one page that already knows all of the id's, because the page knows all of

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:25,000
the users, and that's select.php. Here we already output all users, so how about we add an extra link here.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Looking like this, a href="update.php". Link text is edit, however, the link doesn't go directly to

25
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
update.php, but to update.php?id= placeholder. How do we fill that placeholder?

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Exactly, htmlspecialchars of $row of 'id'. We just read out the id from the database as well, and stuff it

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:07,000
into that link. So by updating the overview page, we provide a very convenient link to the update _____.

28
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Here we have the overview page from before again, showing just the names at the moment.

29
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I reloaded because we changed the select.php page, and now we have to two edit links going to update.php

30
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
id= 1 and 2. Let's edit debbie. You see the form is already pre-filled with debbie, female, and red as

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
her favorite color. Let's just change her color to, let's say, green.

32
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I submit it, and the user has been updated. We can prove that by going back to select.php, and now as you

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
can see, debbie has been updated because now her favorite color is green.

34
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So it was a bit of work, there's still some cleaning up which we may want to do, but still, we now since

35
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
we have learned how to pre-fill a form, how we can also pre-fill an update form and then create the update

36
00:05:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
statement required to update an individual record in our database.
